# Why this repo?
I couldn't find a convenient way to access the artworks generated by the [basepaint.xyz](https://basepaint.xyz/) community, especially offline and/or in pdf/printable format. I created this collection of tools to make it easier to access, share and promote the art created by the community.

# Fonts
The fonts used in this PDF and uploaded to this repo have permissible licenses that allow such uses and distribution to the best of my knowledge (mostly form [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)). The specific use of MEK font for the heading of each image was chosen to mimic the look and feel BasePaint's landing page and its license info is available at https://mek.gallery/fonts-(cc0)
