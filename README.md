# basepaint-media
The main goal of this repository is to be an archive for the art generated by the [basepaint.xyz](https://basepaint.xyz/) community, including metadata and stats. It includes scripts to compile that information and generate PDFs for convenience. The main development branches of that code and instructions on how to run it resides in its companion repository [basepaint](https://github.com/isaacbernat/basepaint)

## Standard PDF edition
The archive is available in PDF form here:

An extended PDF version is available, with twice as many pages as the Standard Edition. Every other page includes 12 thumbnails from the 24 hour creation process of each basepaint artwork. A sample follows:

# Howto
1. Clone the repository: `git clone git@github.com:isaacbernat/basepaint.git`
2. Move into the newly created directory: `cd basepaint`
3. [Get python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and install dependencies:
    ```python
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. Create the archive: `python3 create_archive.py`
    This will create the following files:
    - `images/`: directory containing the images in jpg format for the archive.
    - `pdf/`: directory with pdf bundles containing the archive in book format.
    - `metadata.csv`: csv file containing metadata for each image.
    - `videos/`: directory containing the videos in mp4 format. They condense the 24h process of creating the image.
    - `video_images/`: directory containing images in jpg format extracted from videos. Needed for the mosaic of Work In Progress pages that accompany each image in the pdf version.

## Why this repo?
I couldn't find a convenient way to access the artworks generated by the [basepaint.xyz](https://basepaint.xyz/) community, especially offline and/or in pdf/printable format. I created this collection of tools to make it easier to access, share and promote the art created by the community.
